# Evaluation of cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in embedded systems

The goal of this project is to design and implement a benchmark evaluation system for analyzing the performance of cryptographic algorithms and widely-used security protocols in embedded systems. This project will specifically focus on measuring system performance metrics such as Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) and number of clock cycles to identify optimization opportunities. By developing new benchmarks that focus on modern cryptographic techniques, this project will address the problems found in older or expensive benchmark tools like Embench, Mibench, and EEMBC.

## Implementation Details

In this section, you will explain how you completed your project. It is recommended to use pictures to demonstrate your system model and implementation.
First we did a comprehensive survey on the existing benchmarks and algorithms and did one (to our knowledge) the first survery on cryptographic algorithms in embedded system benchmarks, using the insights, weaknesses and strengths of the algorithms and benchmarks we found we created our own benchmark which has a big advantage over prior benchmarks and it is a main contribution. we calculated the std and we know that the probability that it will take longer than the mean plus 3 to std is less than 1% according to probability and statistics. This makes our benchmark stand out as we have a 99% probability as well!
